# Horizon Travel Airlines – Full-Stack Web Application

This project began as a university **Software Lab coursework** for developing a UK domestic airline booking system. After completing the coursework, I **extended it further** by:

- Adding Docker support for easier local deployment  
- Deploying the system live on the cloud via **PythonAnywhere**  
- Improving structure and maintainability  

The result is a **full-stack web application** for booking flights, with admin tools and secure user functionality.
